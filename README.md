# machine-learning-training
This is a preparation repo for some experiments for the GLG training.

I have a docker file for the basic install they requested.

Run with:
```
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v /Users/dgoldberg/github/machine-learning-training/shared:/home/experiments/shared ml
```

Run shared/start_notebook.sh to start ipython(jupyter) notebook.
